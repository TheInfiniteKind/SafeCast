Don't blindly cast objects. Stick to high-level language features, and write more readable code.\r\n\r\nConditional casting, not unlike Swift's `as?` operator:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\nNSMutableArray *mArray = [NSMutableArray safe_cast:array];\r\n// `mArray` is nil if `array` is not a mutable array, or `array` if it is.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr only call methods on collection members that can respond to the selector.\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[array safe_makeObjectsSafelyPerformSelector:@selector(method)];\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr enumerate with a block on objects that are of a specific kind.\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[array safe_enumerateObjectsOfKind:[MyObject class]\r\n                        usingBlock:^(MyObject *obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {\r\n                            [obj setNumber:@3];\r\n                        }];\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr a protocol\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[array safe_enumerateObjectsConformingToProtocol:@protocol(MyProtocol)\r\n                                      usingBlock:^(id<MyProtocol> *obj, NSUInteger idx, BOOL *stop) {\r\n                                          [obj setNumber:@3];\r\n                                      }];\r\n```\r\n\r\nSafeCast has quite a few methods like this, covering `NSArray`, `NSSet`, `NSDictionary`, and `NSOrderedSet`.\r\n\r\nI doubt it would be a good idea to give coverage to collections like `NSMapTable` or `NSHashTable`, so that's not planned.\r\n\r\n## A Whole Library for _that_?\r\n\r\nWell, first of all, it's _really_ small. The documentation in the headers is _much_ bigger than the code. And it's tested. You may not need it. But it has a lot of things going for it.\r\n\r\n### Easy to integrate \r\n\r\nSafeCast is available as a [CocoaPod](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\npod 'SafeCast'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Be concice and direct with your intent\r\n\r\nIt definitely takes fewer lines of code. In my opinion it's easier to read and think about than the more verbose way of doing it safely. It keeps your type-safety checks up front and at a high level.\r\n\r\n### Be Safe\r\n\r\nMaybe you know what you're doing. But do you always do the right thing? How many people are in your code base? And how well do they all know Objective-C's C underbelly? More and more developers are coming in having worked with higher-level or dynamic languages, and may not realize what's safe and what's not.\r\n\r\nSafeCast wants to make it easier to safely cast ... to cast only when it's safe to do so.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nPlease send feedback, pull-requests, and coffee.\r\n","google":"UA-2286078-12","note":"Don't delete this file!
